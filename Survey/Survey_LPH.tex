With the development of 5G network and the promotion of online office, cloud storage is used more and more. At the same time, the integrity and security of cloud storage in transmission and storage has become a growing focus.

Y. Zhang, C. Xu, X. Lin and X. Shen(2021) proposed a certificate-less public verification scheme against procrastinating auditors (CPVPA) in "Blockchain-Based Public Integrity Verification for Cloud Storage against Procrastinating Auditors"\cite{LPH-1}, by using block-chain technology. And present proofs to demonstrate the security of CPVPA.

In order to avoid high verification cost and information leaks in Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)(which is an important cloud security technique, allowing users to retrieve the encrypted data from the cloud and verify the validity of the results.), X. Ge et al.(2021) designed a novel Accumulative Authentication Tag (AAT) in "Towards Achieving Keyword Search over Dynamic Encrypted Cloud Data with Symmetric-Key Based Verification"\cite{LPH-2}, based on the symmetric-key cryptography. J. Li et al.(2021) put forward the concept of "forward search privacy" in "Searchable Symmetric Encryption with Forward Search Privacy"\cite{LPH-3}, which requires not leaking any information about past queries when searching for newly added documents. They also proposed a new SSE scheme called Khons, and proofed its efficiency by experimenting on wiki.
